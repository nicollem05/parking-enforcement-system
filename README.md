Parking Enforcement Simulator

A robust Java-based system designed to simulate parking management and enforcement logic. This project demonstrates advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through the interaction of multiple complex entities and business rules.

***Key Features**
**Vehicle Management:* Tracks vehicle entry, exit, and identification.
**Enforcement Logic:* Automated fine calculation based on parking duration and zone regulations.
**Multi-Class Interaction:* Implements complex relationships between Drivers, Vehicles, Parking Spots, and Officers.
**Data Substitution:* Features efficient data handling and object interaction to simulate real-world scenarios.

Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Concepts:** Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

Project Structure
The system is built with modularity in mind, separating concerns into distinct classes:
 `Vehicle`: Base class for managing automobile data.
`ParkingLot`: Handles occupancy logic and spot availability.
`ParkingTicket`: Manages the generation and logging of violations.
`Officer`: Simulates the inspection and enforcement process.
